Student Scores Data Analysis
Overview

This project involves the analysis of student score data to uncover insights and trends. The goal is to evaluate the academic performance of students across various subjects and identify patterns that may be useful for educational improvements. The dataset contains information about student scores, demographics, and other relevant factors.

Project Description
Project Description

The project focuses on data cleaning, exploration, and analysis of student scores data. By applying statistical methods and visualizations, the analysis aims to provide answers to the following questions:

What is the overall performance of the students in different subjects?

Are there any significant differences in performance based on gender, age, or other demographic factors?

How can we predict student performance based on certain factors?

What are the key trends and correlations in the data?

Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

Student_ID: A unique identifier for each student.

Gender: The gender of the student (e.g., Male, Female).

Age: The age of the student.

Subject_1_Score: The score in Subject 1.

Subject_2_Score: The score in Subject 2.

Subject_3_Score: The score in Subject 3.

Total_Score: The total score across all subjects.

Grade: The grade the student received (e.g., A, B, C).

School: The school attended by the student.

The data is stored in a CSV file named student_scores.csv.

Technologies Used

Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.

Jupyter Notebook: For interactive analysis and documentation.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning models (if applicable, e.g., prediction).

Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-scores-analysis.git


Navigate into the project directory:

cd student-scores-analysis


Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Open the Jupyter notebook to explore the analysis:

jupyter notebook

Analysis Steps

Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values, if any.

Remove duplicates or irrelevant columns.

Convert data types as necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Descriptive statistics of the dataset (mean, median, standard deviation).

Distribution of scores across subjects.

Correlation analysis between subjects.

Data Visualization:

Visualize score distributions for each subject.

Create bar charts and histograms to explore patterns in the data.

Plot correlations between demographic factors and student scores.

Statistical Analysis:

Perform hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests to check for significant differences between genders or age groups).

Analyze the relationship between subjects using correlation and regression analysis.

Prediction Model (Optional):

Build a machine learning model to predict students' total score or grade based on other features using algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, etc.

Results & Insights

Key Findings:
Summarize the main results and insights derived from the data analysis, such as performance differences between genders, correlation between subjects, etc.

Visualizations:
Include key visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to illustrate the trends in the data.

Predictions (if applicable):
If a prediction model is implemented, describe the model's accuracy and performance.
